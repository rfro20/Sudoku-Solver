## General Information

1. If the inputted board has more than one solution when calling `solve()`, one solution will be shown on the screen. But, it is an **invalid** board nonetheless.
2. Checking your board checks to see if the current board is a valid sudoku board, following the rules of rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes.
